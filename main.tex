%% This is the "preamble" of the document. This is where the format options get set.
%% Pro-tip: things following the % mark will not be compiled by LaTeX. I'll be using them extensively to explain things as we go.
%% Note: not to scare you off of LaTeX, but it's normal to have problems. And ya girl has been having some. I've included the copyright info at the bottom of the document from the guy who wrote this package, because his documentation doesn't entirely match how it's actually used. So this is a combination of his working preamble along with my added commentary or explanation.

%% Document class input explanation ________________
%% LaTeX files need to start with the document class, so it knows what it's using
%% - This file is using the apa7 document class, as it has a lot of the formatting built in
%% There are two sets of brackets in LaTeX, for each command (the things that start with the slash \ )
%% - The squiggle brackets {} are mandatory for executing the command
%% - The square brackets [] are options for that command. There can be more than one set of square brackets for some commands
%% Options used in this document (general note - for each of these, if you want to use the other options, swap it out in that spot in the square brackets):
%% - stu: this sets the `document mode' as the "student paper" version. Other options are jou (journal), man (manuscript, for journal submission), and doc (a plain document)
%% --- The student setting includes things like 'duedate', 'course', and 'professor' on the title page. If these aren't wanted/needed, use the 'man' setting. It also defaults to including the tables and figures at the end of the document. This can be changed by including the 'floatsintext' option, as I have for you. If the instructor wants those at the end, remove that from the square brackets.
%% --- The manuscript setting is roughly what you would use to submit to a journal, so uses 'date' instead of 'duedate', and doesn't include the 'course' or 'professor' info. As with 'stu', it defaults to putting the tables and figures at the end rather than in text. The same option will bump those images in text.
%% --- Journal ('jou') outputs something similar to a common journal format - double columned text and figurs in place. This can be fun, especially if you are sumbitting this as a writing sample in applications.
%% --- Document ('doc') outputs single columned, single spaced text with figures in place. Another option for producing a more polished looking document as a writing sample.
%% - 12pt: sets the font size to 12pt. Other options are 10pt or 11pt
%% - floatsintext: makes it so tables and figures will appear in text rather than at the end. Unforunately, not having this option set breaks the whole document, and I haven't been able to figure out why. IT's GREAT WHEN THINGS WORK LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

%\usepackage[american]{babel}
%
%\usepackage{csquotes} % One of the things you learn about LaTeX is at some level, it's like magic. The references weren't printing as they should without this line, and the guy who wrote the package included it, so here it is. Because LaTeX reasons.
%\usepackage[style=apa,sortcites=true,sorting=nyt,backend=biber]{biblatex}
%\addbibresource{references.bib} % This is the companion file to the main one you're writing. It contains all of the bibliographic info for your references. It's a little bit of a pain to get used to, but once you do, it's the best. Especially if you recycle references between papers. You only have 
%% biblatex: loads the package that will handle the bibliographic info. Other option is natbib, which allows for more customization
%% - style=apa: sets the reference format to use apa (albeit the 6th edition)
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa} % Gotta make sure we're patriotic up in here. Seriously, though, there can be local variants to how citations are handled, this sets it to the American idiosyncrasies  to get the pieces in the holes once.`

%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} 
%\usepackage{mathptmx} % This is the Times New Roman font, which was the norm back in my day. If you'd like to use a different font, the options are laid out here: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Font_typefaces
%% Alternately, you can comment out or delete these two commands and just use the Overleaf default font. So many choices!


%% Title page stuff _____________________
%\title{Some Title} % The big, long version of the title for the title page
%\shorttitle{Some Short title} % The short title for the header
%\author{Tejas Savalia}
%\date{\today}
%% \date{January 17, 2024} The student version doesn't use the \date command, for whatever reason
%\affiliation{UMass Amherst}
%%\course{PSY 4321} % LaTeX gets annoyed (i.e., throws a grumble-error) if this is blank, so I put something here. However, if your instructor will mark you off for this being on the title page, you can leave this entry blank (delete the PSY 4321, but leave the command), and just make peace with the error that will happen. It won't break the document.
%\professor{Dr. Professor}  % Same situation as for the course info. Some instructors want this, some absolutely don't and will take off points. So do what you gotta.
%
%\abstract{This is the abstract for this paper, wherein the main points of the introduction, method, results, and discussion are quickly talked about. Probably in more than one sentence, though. Dare I guess, more than two? There is a page break before starting the Introduction.}

%
%\begin{document}
%\maketitle % This tells LaTeX to make the title page

% \section{Introduction} This command is commented out, because I was taught it was redundant to have the paper's title and introduction together. If your instructor wants it to say "Introduction", delete the % at the start


%% 
%% This is a sample doctoral dissertation.  It shows the appropriate
%% structure for your dissertation.  It should handle most of the
%% strange requirements imposed by the Grad school; like the different
%% handling of titles of one/many appendices.  It will automatically
%% handle the linespacing changes.  The body default is double-spaced
%% (except when you use the singlespace or condensed options).  The
%% default for quotations is single-space, and the default for tabular
%% environments is also single-space.  
%%
%% This class adds the following commands and environments to the
%% report class, upon which it is based:
%% Commands
%% ------------
%% \degree{name}{abbrv} -- Sets the name and abbreviation for the degree.
%%                         These default to ``Doctor of Philosopy''
%%                         and ``Ph.D.'', respectively.
%% \copyrightyear{year} -- for the copyright page.
%% \bachelors{degree}{institution} -- for the abstract
%% \masters{degree}{institution}   --  "
%%     if you have other degrees you may use
%% \secondbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \secondmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \priordoctorate{degree}{institution}
%%
%% \committeechair{name}           -- for the signature page
%% or, if you have two co-chairs:
%% \cochairs{first name}{second name}
%%
%% \firstreader{name}              --  "
%% \secondreader{name}             --  "

%% \departmentname{name}           --  "
%%
%% \copyrightpage                  -- produces the copyright page
%% \signaturepage                  -- produces the signature page
%%
%% \frontmatter                    -- these are required in their various
%% \mainmatter                     -- appropriate locations
%% \backmatter                     --
%%
%% \unnumberedchapter[toc]{name}   -- like \chapter, except that it
%%                                    produces an unnumbered chapter;
%%                                    alternatively, like \chapter*,
%%                                    except that it lists the chapter
%%                                    in the table of contents.
%%
%% New environments:
%%   dedication  -- for the dedication
%%   abstract    -- for the abstract
%%
%% The thesis documentclass is built on top of the report document class.
%% It accepts all of the options that the report class accepts, plus the
%% following:
%%     doublespace -- the default, indicates double spacing as per U.Mass.
%%                    requirements.  You will need this when you do your
%%                    final copy.
%%     singlespace -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school
%%     condensed   -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school,
%%                    creates condensed versions of the frontmatter. 
%%                    Condensed implies singlespace.
%%     dissertation - the default, indicates that this document is a
%%                    dissertation.
%%     proposal    -- indicates that this document is a dissertation proposal,
%%                    rather than a dissertation.  This will only change the
%%                    wording on the title and signature pages.
%%     thesis      -- indicates that this document is a Master's thesis 
%%                    rather than a doctoral dissertation.  This also changes
%%                    the default for \degree to Master of Science, M.S.
%%     allowlisthypenation -- (the default), allows hyphenation of words in
%%                    the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list
%%                    of tables.  I believe that this is acceptable to the 
%%                    Graduate School.
%%     nolisthyphenation -- disallows hyphenation of words in the table of
%%                    contents and the list of figures and tables.  Use this 
%%                    option if the Grad School doesn't like your hyphenation.
%%     nicerdraft  -- relaxes some of the Grad School's rules for working with
%%                    drafts -- has no effect when doublespace is in effect
%%     nonicerdraft -- the default, leaves things in draft as they will be in
%%                     the final version
%% umassthesis changes the default font size to 12pt, but you may specify 10pt or
%%   11pt in the options.
\documentclass[dissertation]{umassthesis}          % for Ph.D. dissertation or proposal
% \documentclass[thesis]{umassthesis}  % for Master's thesis

%%
%% If you have enough figures or tables that you run out of space for their
%% numbers in the List of Tables or List of figures, you can use the following
%% command to adjust the space left for numbers.  The default is shown:
%%
%% \setlength{\tablenumberwidth}{2.3em}

%% Use the hyperref package if you're producing a version for online
%% distribution and you want hyperlinks.  Note that the Grad School doesn't want
%% their PDF viewers to colorize or otherwise highlight the links; use the
%% hidelinks option to hyperref to avoid decorating links.
